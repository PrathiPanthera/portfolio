## Work Experience

I‚Äôm a data science enthusiast with a solid academic foundation and hands-on project experience in Machine Learning, NLP, and Generative AI.  
I previously worked as a Physics Lecturer for a year, which sharpened my analytical thinking and communication skills ‚Äî both critical in solving data-driven problems.

I‚Äôm currently focused on building real-world solutions using Python, MySQL, and GenAI, while actively learning Deep Learning and NoSQL technologies.

## üöÄ Projects

### üö≤ Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PrathiPanthera/Bike_sharing)

Built a multiple linear regression model to predict hourly bike rental demand using features like temperature, humidity, and time variables.  
Performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and statistical diagnostics to build a robust predictive model using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.

### üè™ Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PrathiPanthera/Sales_forecasting)

Forecasted daily sales for Rossmann stores using time series modeling and regression techniques.  
Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering (e.g., holidays, promotions), and built models using **XGBoost** and **Prophet**.  
Final model captured sales seasonality and store-level behavior for better inventory planning.
